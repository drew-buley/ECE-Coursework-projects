This folder contains a hash table project that I completed as a part of my Data Structures and Algorithms class during Fall 2024.
Several of the files were provided as a part of the project to give a sufficient starting point and allow the project to be completed and tested within the time window.

Provided in full:
 - hashes.c
 - Hashes.h
 - makefile
 - table.h

Other files required both major and minor changes to their code to allow for proper functionality.

Provided in partial:
 - lab6.c
 - table.c

The majority of the work I completed on this project was in the implementation of the table.c file.
