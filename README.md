This repository houses a few of the projects I have undertaken during my coursework here at Clemson.

Projects usually were completed over the course of 1 intensive week and included project coding, debugging, testing, and documenting.

Key areas of focus were:
 - learning how/when to utilize different ADTs
 - optomizing time/space complexity
 - debugging via GDB and valgrind.


Clemson students: 
This repository is not to be used to shortcut, or otherwise avoid, doing these projects for your classes. This work represents my solutions to these problems and is public to more easily facilitate linked sharing for the purposes of applications. No permission is given to reuse the entirity, or portions, of this code for your projects without prior written approval by the professor and myself.
