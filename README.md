This repository houses a few of the projects I have undertaken during my coursework here at Clemson.

Projects usually were completed over the course of 1 intensive week and included project coding, debugging, testing, and documenting.

Key areas of focus were learning how/when to utilize different ADTs, optomizing time/space complexity, and debugging via GDB and valgrind.
